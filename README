Kartchamp


RUNNING THE APPLICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT:

- Download and install Maven 3 (http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation). If you have already installed Maven 3, you can skip this step.
- Go the root directory of project (The one which contains the pom.xml file)
- Run command mvn clean jetty:run
- Start your browser and go to the location: http://localhost:8080
- You will have some default data prepared - let's start playing

CREATING PRODUCTION BUILD:
- Run command mvn package -P complete-assembly
- In target folder, find folder kartchamp-build-* and copy it to your installation location
- After copy, copy data folder from project root to your installation location (data separation)
- Run start.bat in bin folder and browse to location http://localhost:9000

RUNING TESTS:
- To run tests, just type mvn test or mvn jasmine:test for javascript unit tests

FEW WORDS ABOUT ARCHITECTURE:
Rule one. Don't panic. Kartchamp uses a little different architecture, then you are probably used to. Long story short, all application 
logic is implemented in javascript on client side in user's browser. Application uses PersistenceJS framework, which transforms all
object operations into sql queries. These queries are sent over http to "serverside", where they are queried against embedded sqlite database.

Originally, application used sqlite database embeded in user's browser (in fact, it still can be easily configured to do so), but due to some 
technical/nontechnical issues, i have moved to embeded database (no problems with browser support, less risk of data loss).
